# Rock-Paper-Scissors with Markov Chains

Welcome to the *Rock-Paper-Scissors with Markov Chains* project! This repository houses an interactive web application that brings a modern twist to the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. By leveraging Markov Chains, the system intelligently predicts user inputs, offering a challenging and engaging gaming experience.

## Overview

*Rock-Paper-Scissors* is a simple game on the surface, but its implementation in this project delves into the complexity of mimicking human-like behavior and enhancing user interaction. The key features of this project include:

- **Markov Chain Prediction**: The system analyzes past sequences of moves to predict the user's next move, adding a strategic element to the game.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Built using HTML, JavaScript, React for the frontend, and Flask for the backend framework, the web application provides a user-friendly interface for seamless gameplay.
- **Digital Scoreboard**: Keep track of your wins, losses, and ties with the built-in digital scoreboard.
- **Graphical Representations**: Visualize the moves played by both the player and the computer, enhancing the gaming experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the *Rock-Paper-Scissors with Markov Chains* project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend components.
4. Run the application locally using the provided scripts.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, simply navigate to the provided URL to access the game interface. From there, you can play *Rock-Paper-Scissors* against the computer, observe the predictions made by the Markov Chain algorithm, and track your performance on the digital scoreboard.

Thank you for your interest in the *Rock-Paper-Scissors with Markov Chains* project. Have fun playing, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
